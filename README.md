# Rust-ML: From Zero to GPT-2

A deep learning framework built entirely from scratch in Pure Rust.

## Project Mission
My main objective with this repository is to learn and practice Rust by implementing the main deep learning concepts from scratch - using no libraries other than the standard Rust library.

Additionally, because this is a *learning* project, I will absolutely not use AI for code generation. All code in this repository was written by me.

## The Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current)
- [x] Basic Matrix Engine.
- [x] MNIST Digit Classification (Single Layer).
- [x] Deep Neural Network (MLP) with modular layers.
- [ ] **Next:** Framework polish (Optimizers, Checkpointing, and Testing).

### Phase 2: Computer Vision
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- [ ] Data Augmentation and Batch Normalization.
- [ ] CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 Classification.

### Phase 3: Generative Models
- [ ] Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- [ ] Latent Diffusion Models.

### Phase 4: Natural Language Processing
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs.
- [ ] Attention Mechanisms & Transformers.
- [ ] **GPT-2**: Training a small-scale language model from scratch.
